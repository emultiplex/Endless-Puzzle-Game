EndlessPuzzle Game

A Gamified Engagement Experience for the Endless Ecosystem

 Overview

EndlessPuzzle is a lightweight, skill-based jigsaw puzzle game designed to improve user engagement, retention, and onboarding within the Endless Protocol ecosystem. It transforms ecosystem interaction into a fun, time-based challenge that encourages repeat participation while building a sense of familiarity and community.
At the heart of the game is Nessy, the Endless mascot, who guides players through each challenge and represents the welcoming spirit of the Endless ecosystem.

 Background & Motivation

Since joining the Endless Protocol community, I have been thinking deeply about how to build something that makes users feel that Endless is not just a platform, but a place they can call home. I wanted to create an experience where interaction feels natural, enjoyable, and rewarding rather than transactional.
This idea led to the creation of EndlessPuzzle. By centering the experience around Nessy, the Endless mascot, the game creates a familiar and friendly environment that encourages users to return, explore, and engage consistently with the ecosystem.

 Problem Statement

Decentralized platforms often struggle with sustained user engagement, especially during onboarding and community campaigns. Many existing campaign mechanics rely on static tasks or one-time interactions, which fail to motivate users to return regularly.

This results in:
Low retention rates
Limited emotional connection with the ecosystem
Reduced long-term campaign impact
